# I call it Stadia.js (written in rust 🚀🦀)™️

<br/>

## Background:

The web is like a pendulum that swings between server and client focused development. We just swung from the SPA era into the isomorphic era. This means server centric frameworks are gonna be the new hotness soon.

<br/>

## The premise of stadia.js (written in rust 🚀🦀)™️:

Rather than requiring the client to run code, css, html, wasm, etc. we run our websites entirely on the server and stream the display to users via jpeg. For user interactions, we simply send input events to the server, update the view, and stream it back.

<br/>

## Profit
To make money, we introduce a subscription model to host GPU-accelerated sites to help with speed, scaling, and responsiveness.
